# Web-development
I took a 2 week course at Oxford Scholastica Academy 2021-2022 summer, also self studied the languages HTML and CSS through Code Academy.
- Codeacademy labeled files are self for self study
- Class file contains my work from the lessons
- Cool webpage was a practice before our project website in the Academy
- GeoMed is a project website I did while working with the Business course's students. Our mission was to not allow any medicine going to third world and developing countries to be wasted. Furthermore, our plan was to build centers in counties of need to store the medicine.
